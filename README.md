<ol>

 <li>Implement the binary heap-based version of the Dijkstraâ€™s algorithm.</li>

 <li>Consider the contraction hierarchies presented during the course. Assume to deal with graphs that can be fully represented in the memory of your computer. Implement:

  <ul>

   <li>an algorithm to add the shortcuts to a graph;</li>

   <li>a bidirectional version of Dijkstra algorithm that can operate on the graphs decorated by the algorithm at Point 2a.</li>

  </ul></li>
